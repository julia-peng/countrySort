# countrySort

This is a program that can take a list of inputted countries along with their respect capital cities and populations, sort them in order of either name or population and print it out to a text file.

The special challenge posed in this program is that there are countries with capital names that have more than one word. Since the program cannot recognize these exceptions automatically, it must be handled explicitly by us. To combat this issue, we created a String to hold all the exceptions and their respective index. Then, when the program identifies that there is an exception, it is equipped to handle it properly.

This was done with Lily Liu and Jonathan Ye for the ICS4U course.
